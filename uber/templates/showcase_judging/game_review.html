                <dd>
                    This category focuses on how ready the game appears to be when shown to the public. This means the degree of visual and audible asset completion as well any programming bugs.

                    No two games are alike; some have a strong narrative or visuals while others may be more focused on mechanics or puzzle design. This category is for how well the judge feels that the game addresses its own central concept.
                    For example, if it is a puzzle game, are the puzzles good? If it is a narrative-driven game, is the story compelling?

                        <em>Scores 7-10</em>

                <dd>
                    Games can be enjoyed for any number of reasons such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Challenging your reflexes and skill</li>
                        <li>Making you think</li>
                        <li>Taking you on a journey</li>
                        <li>Making you laugh</li>
                    </ul>
                    So this category is wide open. In terms of what the game sought out to do, how enjoyable was it?

                    There is no point breakdown here, just score it 1-10! Include additional information in the "Comments for the Devs" section about what you thought about the game.
