    <h3>{{ c.EVENT_NAME_AND_YEAR }}<br/> Emails that need approval to send on behalf of {{ primary_sender }}:</h3>

    <p>
        The following automated emails are ready to send, but still require manual approval of their content by admins.
        If these emails are valid for your department this year, please use the links below to approve them
        as soon as possible. The purpose of the approval process is to make sure departments have control over the
