Ahoy {{ game.studio.primary_contact_first_names }},

Congratulations!  Your game submission ({{ game.title }}) has been chosen to be part of the {{ c.ESCHATON.year }} MAGFest Indie Videogame Showcase (MIVS).

*** You now need to either CONFIRM or DECLINE your acceptance! ***

Please confirm your spot OR decline it at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/mivs/continue_app?id={{ game.studio.id }}

You have until {{ game.studio.confirm_deadline|datetime_local }} to confirm (or decline).
