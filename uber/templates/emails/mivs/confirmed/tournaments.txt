Ahoy {{ game.studio.primary_contact_first_names }},

Congrats on presenting at the MAGFest Indie Videogame Showcase! 

We want to know if you would like to run a Leaderboard Challenge or Tournament at the Showcase.

* To run a Leaderboard Challenge your game should have a way to track a high score, distance, or highest level of some sort.

* To run a Tournament your game should contain some sort of head to head/ Versus mode where a Single Elimination bracket can be used. We can run them at your booth or at the Large Tournament Collider.

If you are interested, please email mivs@magfest.org expressing your interest.

Forever your Fan,
