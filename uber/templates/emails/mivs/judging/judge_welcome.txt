Judging will begin soon and go until {{ c.MIVS_JUDGING_DEADLINE|datetime_local }}.

As a judge, you'll be responsible for judging a dozen games. Expect to spend at least 15 minutes per game to get a good idea for how the games feels. 

You'll be giving the games a score from 1-10 based on three categories:
<b>Show Readiness</b> - how ready the game appears to be when shown to the public. This means the degree of visual and audible asset completion as well any programming bugs.
<b>Overall Design</b> - how well the judge feels that the game addresses its own central concept. (I.e. If it is a puzzle game, are the puzzles good? If it is a narrative-driven game, is the story compelling?)
<b>Overall Enjoyment</b> - how enjoyable was the game? Did it keep you on your toes, make you laugh, push your reflexes to the limit?

There will also be a space for you to leave constructive feedback and will be sent to the developers after judging completes. 

You will have until {{ c.MIVS_JUDGING_DEADLINE|datetime_local }} to complete judging for your entries.  

From all of us here on the MIVS team and all the independent developers, we thank you for your continued help in making MIVS incredible, year after year!
