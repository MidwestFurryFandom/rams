Ahoy {{ game.studio.primary_contact_first_names }},

Here is a December update with general reminders and new information for the upcoming {{c.EVENT_YEAR}} MAGFest Indie Video Game Showcase!

====
MIVS Checklist
====

You may have seen emails from us about your MIVS checklist.  Even if you are not taking advantage of items such as selling or hotels (or they are past the deadline), we still need you to complete them. Doing so will prevent a MIVS volunteer from sending you an email asking for you to finish them.

You can view your checklist at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/guests/index?id={{ game.studio.group.guest.id }}

Thanks to all of you who have already completed your checklists ahead of time!

====
Communication - Discord Server
====

Reminder that we have a private Discord server which helps us disseminate quick communications, reminders, etc. Please use this link to join: https://discord.gg/vmGr5yMP 

Follow the instructions on the #getting-started page to get set up as a dev for 2025! After joining, please be sure you change your name in the server to the following format: Your Name (The Name of Your Game) 

If you are alumni already in the MIVS Server: please go to the #getting-started page and select MIVS 2025 Dev.

We recommend downloading the Discord App to have on your mobile device during MAGFest.

====
Hotels
====

This is the final week to book if you would like a room on-site at the Gaylord! If you would like to reserve a Gaylord room, you may do so from your checklist before the deadline of midnight Sunday, December 15th.

You can view your checklist at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/guests/index?id={{ game.studio.group.guest.id }}

If you need to check or change info on your reservation, you can contact the Maritz booking agency at 469-513-9379 or email magfest@maritz.com

====
Selling
====

If you would like to sell merch or your game at the event, please complete the forms under the Selling at MAGFest section of your checklist.

After completing the forms online, you will want to submit them to the MAGFest portal as well as bring a copy of your temporary license to the event to display at your booth.

====
Layout
====
Our Layout Team has been hard at work configuring this year's expo space. We are awaiting final sign off that all safety and accessibility guidelines have been met. After that time, we will share the layout. If you have certain needs for your booth placement, please email mivs@magfest.org as soon as possible so we can take that into consideration. While we cannot guarantee requests can be met, we will do our best to accommodate where we can.

====
Cancellations
====
We understand emergencies happen, and they may prevent you from participating at MIVS this year. If this happens, please contact us ASAP so we can allow a waitlisted team to participate. Letting us know ahead of time leaves you on good terms with the MIVS team. Being a no-show at the event places extra work on the volunteer staff and may prevent you from being part of MIVS in the future. 

If you simply need to switch out team members, your group leader can manage your studio's badges from your group management page.

====
Indie Green Room, Discussion Groups, and Press
====

We have been given a wonderful opportunity this year to have an indie green room outside of the main event space for the entirety of the event. In addition to taking a break and socializing with your fellow indies, we'd like to give you the opportunity to use the space for any special interest discussion groups or jam sessions that require a quieter atmosphere.

Additionally, having access to this quiet space means that we have the perfect venue for recording interviews. We are piloting a program to allow sing-day access to the convention which mean we have the ability to give press access to the show floor and you! If you would like to put any press in contact with us or have any outlets you would like us to reach out to, please email (or have them email) mivs@magfest.org. We know some of you have your own social media followings/podcasts/streams as well. Please know that the room to record is also available to you if you are interested.

We'll be building out a schedule for the room over the next month. If you would like to use the space, please email mivs@magfest so we can try to fit you in.

====
More on the horizon...
====

We have some other exciting opportunities in the works like an indie mixer and a developer panel with a visiting school's STEAM club. Stay tuned to Discord for more information as these things are finalized.

====
Other Questions & Live Q&A
====

If you have questions, you can always contact us by emailing mivs@magfest.org or drop a note to us in Discord.

We will also be hosting a series of one hour live Q&A sessions in the Discord voice channels. This is the perfect time to ask the MIVS team all your burning questions, especially if it's your first time with us. The current schedule is below. Keep an eye on the Discord for any additional sessions or updates.

Tuesday, December 10th 7pm-8pm Eastern
Sunday, December 15th 8pm-9pm Eastern
Wednesday, January 8th 8pm-9pm Eastern


Forever Your Fan,
-The MIVS Team
