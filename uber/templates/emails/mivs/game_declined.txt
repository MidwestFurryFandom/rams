Thank you for your game submission ({{ game.title }}) to the MAGFest Indie Videogame Showcase (MIVS).

We regret to inform you that your game did not qualify for booth space at MIVS this year.

However, if you'd still like to show your game in the MIVS area at MAGFest, you still have the opportunity with "QuickPlay"!

QuickPlay is an area within MIVS where booth spaces are set aside for indies to show their game for a block of time.  As an indie, you'll be able to sign up for a 2 hour block of time, with possibly more blocks depending on availability.  We will provide a 6' table, 4 chairs, and access to a power drop.  You will need to provide your own equipment.  (WIFI/Network connections will not be available.)

Signups for Quickplay will not happen online. They will only be available on-site at MAGFest in the MIVS area and will require you to have purchased a MAGFest badge.  Signups will be on a first come, first serve basis, so we recommend visiting the MIVS area at your earliest convenience after picking up your MAGFest badge.
