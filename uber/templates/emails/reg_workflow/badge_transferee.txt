{{ attendee.first_name }},

Your pending {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} badge with the transfer code {{ transferee_code }} has now been activated using transfer code {{ transferer_code }}. This means you now have a valid registration for {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}!

You can use this link to view or update your badge: {{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.id }}

Badges are not mailed out before the event, so your badge will be available for pickup at the registration desk when you arrive at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}. Simply bring a photo ID to the registration desk, where you'll be provided with your badge. If you ordered any merchandise, you can pick those up at our merchandise booth. The location and hours of the registration desk and merchandise booth will be emailed prior to the event. {% if c.CONSENT_FORM_URL and attendee.age_group_conf['consent_form'] %}

Our records indicate that you are under the age of 18, and as such, you will need a signed parental consent form. If a parent/guardian will be present at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, then they can sign the consent form when you pick up your badge at the registration desk. If a parent/guardian will not be at the event, the form may be brought pre-signed, however it MUST be notarized. We will not accept pre-signed forms that are not notarized. You may find the form at {{ c.CONSENT_FORM_URL }}.

If you are actually over 18, you can update your age in our database at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.id }} before {{ c.UBER_TAKEDOWN|datetime_local }}.
