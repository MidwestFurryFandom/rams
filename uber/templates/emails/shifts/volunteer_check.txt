Thanks for preregistering for {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}! You checked a box on your registration form which indicated that you were interested in volunteering, and {% if c.UBER_TAKEDOWN < c.EPOCH %}the deadline for signing up for shifts is coming up{% else %}{{ c.EVENT_NAME }} is rapidly approaching{% endif %}. If you'd still like to help, you can sign up for shifts {{ ('until ' ~ c.UBER_TAKEDOWN|datetime_local) if c.UBER_TAKEDOWN < c.EPOCH else 'anytime' }} by logging in at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/staffing/login?first_name={{ attendee.first_name|urlencode }}&last_name={{ attendee.last_name|urlencode }}&email={{ attendee.email|urlencode }}&zip_code={{ attendee.zip_code|urlencode }}

It's fine if you decide not to volunteer; you have until {{ c.DROP_SHIFTS_DEADLINE.astimezone(c.EVENT_TIMEZONE).strftime('%B %-e') }} to drop any shifts you signed up for. Otherwise, please contact STOPS at {{ c.STAFF_EMAIL|email_only }}.{% if c.UBER_TAKEDOWN < c.EPOCH %} If you missed the deadline for signing up for shifts, come see us in Staffing Ops at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} and we'll let you know what shifts are still available.{% endif %}
