                <strong>How does this work?</strong>
                <p>
                    Declined {{ c.DEALER_TERM }}s can be converted to individual attendee badges.
                    This releases every assigned badge to the person it is assigned to and sends them an email to claim their badge -- an example of this email is on this page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to claim their badge, they must pay the cost of an attendee badge when their {{ c.DEALER_APP_TERM }} was submitted.
                    For example, if their {{ c.DEALER_APP_TERM }} was submitted four months ago, and badge prices at that time were $120,
                    they would need to pay $120 to finish registering. After that, they will be able to pick their badge up like any other attendee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Groups will also {% if not c.DELETE_DECLINED_GROUPS %}NOT {% endif %} be deleted</strong>{% if c.DELETE_DECLINED_GROUPS %} unless they have badges that are not 'paid by group'{% endif %}.
                    If you wish to change this, please contact your developer.
                </p>
                <strong>When should I enable this?</strong>
                <p>
                    The task to convert these badges runs every night at midnight UTC. If you use an automated decline email, make sure that email
                    <a href="../email_admin/pending" target="_blank">has been approved</a> before marking any badges for conversion.
                    Otherwise, {{ c.DEALER_INDEFINITE_TERM }} may get an email referencing a declined application before they get the declined application notice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to mark a group for conversion, you can either check the "Convert this group's badges to individual badges" checkbox on their form,
                    OR set the status for all declined {{ c.DEALER_TERM }}s and then click the "Convert Declined {{ c.DEALER_TERM|title }}'s Badges"
                    button on the <a href="../group_admin/index#dealers" target="_blank">main group listing.</a>
                </p>
                <strong>What about unassigned badges?</strong>
                <p>
                    <strong>Unassigned badges are DELETED</strong> when the badge conversion takes place. If your {{ c.DEALER_TERM }}s
                    are counting on a discounted badge price (for example, if the jurying period is lengthy), please make sure they understand this.
