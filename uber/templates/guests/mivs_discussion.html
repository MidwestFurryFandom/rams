  <h3>MIVS Discussion Group</h3>
  <p>In the future, you will be invited to join a google discussion group. This will have MIVS Staff, as well as other Indies that are part of MIVS this year on it. This group is here to help facilitate discussion with your peers, and for MIVS staff to more easily send information to you.</p>

  <p>The primary contact for your game will be added to the group. You may enter emails for any team members associated with your game who you think should also be added to the group.</p>

  <p>We use Discord as our primary means of communication during the event and we host Q&A's leading up to the event in the voice channels. The MIVS Discord is also a great way to start networking not just with this year's showcasing devs, but with MIVS alumni developers. You can join the MIVS Discord here: <a href="https://discord.gg/Mw5ArhYzQQ" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/Mw5ArhYzQQ</a></p>
