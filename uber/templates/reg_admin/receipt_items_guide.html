    <h3>Receipt Items Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Each attendee, group, and art show application has a list of receipt items that record that attendee or group's purchases, credits, payments, and refunds.
      Below is an example of a typical receipt for an attendee.
      <br/><img src="../static/images/receipt-guide/receipt-example.png" class="col-12 col-sm-8">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Purchase items</strong> record something that the attendee or group owes money for. Each purchase item corresponds to one type of purchase.
          In the example above, this attendee bought a badge and a merch package, which was recorded as two purchase items.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Credit items</strong> are the opposite of purchases and reduce the amount of money the attendee or group owes.
          For example, an age discount adds a credit.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Payment items</strong> record the attendee or group paying for their purchases, minus any credits on their receipt.
          Each payment item corresponds to one transaction, as in the example above.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Refund items</strong> record any money we refund back to the attendee or group.
          Like payments, each refund item corresponds to a single transaction.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      This system allows a clear view of the history of money-related changes to that attendee, group, or application.
      It also allows admins better control of what someone owes for their group, badge, or art show application.
      Most importantly, it allows admins to refund attendees via {{ processors_str }} for either specific items or for the entire cost of their badge/application, including add-ons.
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
    <p>
      There's a few important things to keep in mind when working with receipt items:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Receipt items are public.</strong> Attendees and groups have a button to view their receipt, including descriptions of receipt items. This allows them to understand what they're being charged for.</li>
        <li><strong>Receipt items may need correcting.</strong> Due to technical limitations, the system may sometimes calculate updates to existing receipts incorrectly. Please contact your developer if this happens.</li>
        <li><strong>Attendees are NOT notified of receipt changes.</strong> The system will not automatically email the attendee or group when their receipt changes, even if they owe money. They will see a balance on their badge or group if they happen to {% if c.ATTENDEE_ACCOUNTS_ENABLED %}log in{% else %}view their confirmation or group management page{% endif %}. Attendees who are not paid up (or are in groups that owe money) will not be able to check in.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12 col-sm-6">
      <h3>Refunding Receipt Items</h3>
        <p>You can refund attendees and groups a few different ways:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Record a Refund:</strong> This adds a record of a refund to a receipt, allowing you to record, e.g., cash refunds.
          <strong>This will not refund a transaction via {{ processors_str }},</strong> it is only used to record refunds.
          See <a href="#manual-receipt-guide">"Manually Updating Receipt Items"</a> for instructions on recording refunds.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Comp and Refund:</strong> This adds a credit to the receipt for a selected purchase, then processes a refund for that amount.
          For example, you would use this to comp and refund someone's badge without cancelling their registration.
        </p>
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
          <a class="btn btn-primary col-12 col-sm-6 mb-2" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#comprefund" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="comprefund">
            Show instructions
          </a>
        </div>
        <p>
          <ol class="collapse" id="comprefund">
            <li>
              Find and click the "Refund Options" button for the item you want to comp.
              <br/><img src="../static/images/receipt-guide/badge-refund-1.png" class="col-12">
              <br/><br/>
            </li>
            <li>
              In the dialog box that opens, click the "Comp and Refund" button.
              <br/><img src="../static/images/receipt-guide/badge-refund-2.png" class="col-12 col-sm-6">
              <br/><br/><strong>If you don't see a "Comp and Refund" button</strong>, that means the system is unable to figure out how
              to automatically comp and refund this item. You should use the "Arbitrary Refund" method below instead.
              <br/><br/>
            </li>
            <li>
              The page will reload. The receipt will now have two new receipt items: a record of the automatic refund,
              and a credit item comping the original item cost (in this case, the badge cost).
              <img src="../static/images/receipt-guide/badge-refund-3.png" class="col-12">
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Undo and Refund:</strong> This adds a credit to the receipt for a selected purchase, processes a refund for that amount,
          AND changes the attendee, group, or application to revert whatever purchase was made.
          For example, you would use this to cancel and refund an upgrade purchased by an attendee.
        </p>
        <p>Note: This option is not available for all receipt items. For example, it is not possible to undo and refund a badge purchase.</p>

              <br/><img src="../static/images/receipt-guide/merch-refund-2.png" class="col-12 col-sm-6">
              <br/><br/>{% if not c.AUTHORIZENET_LOGIN_ID %}
                The "Undo and Refund Excluding Fees" button will work similarly, but will leave {{ processors_str }} processing fees out of the refund.
                This is in case your department has a policy where processing fees are excluded from refunds.
              {% else %}
                The "Undo and Refund Excluding Fees" button will not appear for you as it is not enabled for {{ processors_str }}.
              {% endif %}
              <br/><br/><strong>If you don't see an "Undo and Refund" button</strong>, the system is for some reason unable to figure out how
              to automatically undo and refund this item. You will need to edit the attendee or group's registration manually, then use the "Arbitrary Refund" method below instead.
              <br/><br/>
            </li>
            <li>
              The page will reload. The receipt will now have two new receipt items: a record of the automatic refund,
              and a credit item noting that the original item was removed from the attendee or group (in this case, a merch package).
              The attendee or group's registration will also have been updated to reflect the change, so they will no longer have the
              item in question attached to their badge or group.
              <br/><img src="../static/images/receipt-guide/merch-refund-3.png" class="col-12">
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Arbitrary Refund:</strong> If you want to add a custom discount or credit that isn't the full amount of a purchased item,
          or you want to comp and refund multiple items at once, you can add that credit item to the receipt and then choose a transaction to refund that amount to.
          For example, if you need to give an attendee a discount on their merch, you would add the discount amount and then
          refund that amount to a transaction of your choice.
        </p>
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
          <a class="btn btn-primary col-12 col-sm-6 mb-2" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#arbitrefund" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="arbitrefund">

              Add a credit item to the receipt describing the discount you are giving the attendee or group.
              See <a href="#manual-receipt-guide">"Manually Updating Receipt Items"</a> for instructions on adding
              credit items. In the example below, we added a credit item with the description "Partial Merch Credit" and a value of $30.
              <br/><img src="../static/images/receipt-guide/arbit-refund-1.png" class="col-12">
              <br/><br/>
            </li>
            <li>
              Find the transaction you want to refund. In the example below, there's three items -- one transaction for the original 
              badge purchase, one purchase item when the attendee added a merch package, and the transaction paying for the merch package.
              Since both transactions total over $30, we can click the "Refund $30" button next to either of them.
              <br/><img src="../static/images/receipt-guide/arbit-refund-2.png" class="col-12">
              <br/><br/>It's important to pick the right transaction here! Each transaction may have been paid with a different credit card, so
              do you best to select the transaction that most closely matches what you are comping for the attendee or group.
              Since this credit is for merch, we'll select the button next to the payment the attendee made for adding merch to their badge.
              <br/><br/><strong>If you don't see any "Refund $XX" button</strong>, that means no transaction item on the receipt has
              enough money to cover the full credit item. In this case, you should split the credit into smaller chunks and
              go through these steps twice to refund each part of the credit.
              <br/><br/>
            </li>
            <li>
              In the dialog box that opens, click the "Refund $XX" (in this case, $30) button.

              The page will reload. The receipt will now have a receipt item recording the automatic refund, which is shown below along
              with the custom credit item we added in step 1.

      <h3 id="manual-receipt-guide">Manually Updating Receipt Items</h3>
      <p>Admins are able to add, delete, and undo receipt items manually. This is useful in a few cases, for example:
        <ul>
          <li>Adding a custom discount, like a discount for merch.</li>
          <li>Cancelling an unpaid upgrade or add-on.</li>
          <li>Correcting a system miscalculation, which can happen in some (hopefully rare) cases.</li>
          <li>Recording a refund processed outside the system, like a refund for a cash payment.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>You can manually edit receipts in the following ways:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Create a Receipt:</strong> Receipts for attendees and groups aren't always created immediately.
        "Placeholder" attendees created by admins, or unapproved dealer groups, won't get a receipt generated until they claim their badge or are approved and start the payment process, respectively.
        You can bypass this in order to add custom items to a receipt before an attendee tries to claim their badge and pay.
      </p>

            If an attendee or group doesn't have an active receipt, the two buttons below will appear on their page.
            In most cases, you should use "Create Default Receipt" to simulate how the system would create someone's receipt when they claim their badge and pay.

            The receipt below is an example of what the system might generate when you create a default receipt.
            The attendee now owes money for their badge, but you can add credits or custom purchases before they claim their badge and pay.

            If you use "Create Blank Receipt" instead, you will bypass any automatic calculations for how much the attendee owes and for what, and create a receipt with no line items.

                Hopefully you won't need to use this, but if you do, make sure your developer knows what happened.

            <br/><br/>In this case, the attendee paid via cash so we select the "Cash" payment method and simply enter "Cash payment" as the description.

            Note that the "Custom Merch" item we added no longer has the "Delete Item" button available.
            This is because the payment we added brought the receipt balance to $0, so all 'open' purchases (in this case, just the Custom Merch item) are now considered paid for.
            You can delete the transaction to reverse this process.

        <strong>Add a Custom Discount:</strong> Although you can give attendees promo codes to get a discount, promo codes only apply to the badge cost.
        If you want to instead add a discount for an item, like discounted merch for certain comped attendees, you'll need to manually edit their receipts.
        We hope to streamline this process in the future, but in the meantime, you should follow the steps below.
      </p>
      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <a class="btn btn-primary col-12 col-sm-6 mb-2" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#discountitem" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="discountitem">

      <p>
        <ol class="collapse" id="discountitem">
          <li>
            Because this attendee was created by an admin, their receipt hasn't been created yet.
            In this case, we want a receipt to exist so we can update it, so click the "Create Default Receipt" button.
            <br/><img src="../static/images/receipt-guide/create-receipt-1.png" class="col-12 col-sm-6">
            <br/><br/>
            This will create a receipt with whatever items are appropriate for the attendee or group.
            In this case, the attendee is a comped staffer so they won't owe any money.
            <br/><br/>
          </li>
          <li>
            In order to add a discount to an item, we need to first add the item to the attendee's registration.
            Click "Attendee Data" in the top bar.
            <br/><img src="../static/images/receipt-guide/discount-merch-2.png" class="col-12 col-sm-6">

          <li>
            This attendee wants to buy the pre-ordered merch package called the "Korok Tier".
            Click the "Badge Extras" button on the left-hand side, then use the dropdown to add a merch package to this attendee's registration.
            Your event's add-ons may look different, but most of them should be in the Badge Extras section like this one.
            <br/><img src="../static/images/receipt-guide/discount-merch-3.png" class="col-12 col-sm-6">
            <br/><br/>
            Because the merch package comes with a shirt, we'll also need to set a shirt size.
            After you've updated the add-on you want, click "Save" to add it to the attendee's registration.
            <br/><br/>
          </li>
          <li>
            The new merch has been added to the attendee's receipt automatically as a purchase item.
            Now it's time to add the discount. In the row of buttons labeled "Purchase", "Credit", "Payment", and "Refund", click "Credit".
            <br/><img src="../static/images/receipt-guide/discount-merch-4.png" class="col-12">
            <br/><br/>
          </li>
          <li>
            A new row will appear with a description, amount, and quantity to fill in.
            Enter a description and the dollar amount the discount should be, then click "Record Credit".
            <br/><img src="../static/images/receipt-guide/discount-merch-5.png" class="col-12">

          </li>
          <li>
            The page will reload. Your new credit item will appear on the receipt.
            At this point, the attendee can {% if c.ATTENDEE_ACCOUNTS_ENABLED %}log in{% else %}view their confirmation or group management page{% endif %}
            and they will be prompted to pay the remaining $30 for their merch.

        <strong>Delete, Comp, and Undo Receipt Items:</strong> Existing receipt items can be altered without refunding money to the attendee or group.
        This can be useful for adjusting an attendee or group's receipt before they pay the balance.
        For example, you can undo a badge upgrade for an attendee who started buying a badge upgrade but stopped before paying.
        This can also be helpful for fixing receipt calculation errors.

            Below is an example of a merch package that an attendee selected, but cancelled payment for.
            They have contacted us and asked for the merch upgrade to be removed from their account, so we'll click the "Undo Item" button for that purchase.

          <li>
            The page will refresh and a new credit will be added to the receipt noting how the item was reverted.
            The attendee's registration is also updated to go back to the merch they had purchased before upgrading.
            <br/><img src="../static/images/receipt-guide/edit-items-3.png" class="col-12">

          <li>
            Items can also be deleted or comped.
            Deleting a receipt item will remove it from the receipt without any other changes, so should generally only be done to correct a mistake.
            Comping an item will add a credit to the receipt for that item's amount. The process for deleting or comping an item is the same as undoing an item.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cancel Payments:</strong> Attendees may sometimes start a payment and neither finish paying nor cancel it themselves.
        If you are editing a receipt total, or the payment is otherwise not for the correct amount, you can mark it as cancelled.
        This will remove the "finish paying" prompt that attendees and groups see and recalculate the amount they owe the next time they {% if c.ATTENDEE_ACCOUNTS_ENABLED %}log in{% else %}view their confirmation or group management page{% endif %}.
